				<p>Sorry. I can&#39;t resist. John Carson, a fellow runner from Canada, unearthed this photo from the archives of the Toronto Star. It&#39;s the finals of the 1500 meters at the Ontario 14-year-old championships, many many years ago. The runner on the left is Dave Reid, who was the greatest Canadian miler of his generation. I will only say this: in this particular race, Reid placed second. I &quot;retired&quot; from competitive running a year later, in large part because I realized that the particular statistical fluke represented by me beating Dave Reid was unlikely to ever be repeated. (For the runners out there, I believe I ran something like 4:05.)&#0160;</p><p>

points, in response.</span></span></span></span></span></o:p></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:0in;line-height:16.5pt"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;
color:black"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&#0160;</span>Roy is of the impression
that that I believe we should abandon rational drug design and, as he puts it,
“go back to the old way of doing things: of throwing mud on a wall and seeing
what sticks.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:0in;line-height:16.5pt"><span style="font-size:14.0pt;
color:black"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </span>I’m not sure where he
gets that idea. “The Treatment” makes it clear <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&#0160;</span>that both strategies—rational drug design and
mass screening--have a place in drug development. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&#0160;</span>When the biology of a disease is well
understood (as in the case of Herceptin and breast cancer) then the former
strategy makes sense. But in those cases where it is not, then there is much to
be said for following a more serendipitous path. I suspect that most drug development experts would agree with me on this. In fact,
it’s probably the case—contra Roy--that one of the most compelling criticisms
of the drug industry at the moment is that it has gone too far in the rational
direction. In a piece in the December “Nature Reviews,” for example, Bernard
Munos writes:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:0in;line-height:16.5pt">Success in the pharmaceutical
industry depends on the random occurrence of a few ‘black swan’&#0160;products.
&#0160;<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Common processes that are
standard practice in most companies create little value in an industry
dominated by blockbusters. These include developing sales forecasts for new products,
which are inaccurate nearly 80% of the time. Another example is portfolio
management, which has e</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">been
widely adopted by the industry as a risk management tool, but has failed to
protect it from patent cliffs. During the past couple of decades, there has
been a methodical attempt to codify every facet of the drug business into
sophisticated processes, in an effort to reduce the variances and increase the
predictability. This has produced a false sense of control over all aspects of
the pharmaceutical enterprise, including innovation.</span> </p>

<p style="margin-top:0in;line-height:16.5pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;</span><span style="font-size: 15px; "><span style="font-size: 19px; ">
</span></span><span style="font-size:16.0pt"><span style="font-size: 14px; "><span style="font-size: 14px; "><span style="font-size: 19px; ">I got the impression from from Roy’s piece
that he was trying very hard to disagree with me. (Calling his post &quot;Malcolm Gladwell is Wrong,&quot; was one clue). &#0160;I’m not sure the effort
was successful. He points out, for example, that some doubted Synta’s promising
phase two data, in the belief that they were an artifact of the trial design:
that there were differences in the health status of the control and treatment arms of the
study. A good portion of my piece, of course, is devoted to the same general argument.
What interested me was in describing the complications and difficulties
and in many cases unavoidable issues in trial design that can make a drug look far more promising
in early clinical testing than it actually is. <o:p></o:p></span></span></span></span></p>

years in the hopes of using its story for one of his books: the story of how
luck and intuition can lead to pharmaceutical success. But the opposite
happened, and the account ended up in</span><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="font-size: 12px; ">&#0160;</span></span><em><span style="font-size: 12px; ">The

that I give them my leftovers! &#0160;And I wish it were the case that I knew what my next book was all about! The truth is that &quot;The Treatment&quot; was always a New Yorker piece. And&#0160;I had no preconceptions about
how the Synta story might end when I began reporting it, except that I guessed
that would be a good case study in the many difficulties of coming up with
new cancer drugs. Unfortunately for the many thousands of melanoma patients
around the world, it was.&#0160;</span></span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">In Sunday’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/books/review/Letters-t-LETSGOTOTHET_LETTERS.html?_r=1">New York Times Book Review</a>, Steven Pinker responds to my description of him as occupying the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&#0160;</span>“lonely ice floe of IQ fundamentalism”:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 18pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">What Malcolm Gladwell calls a “lonely ice floe” is what psychologists call “the mainstream.” In a 1997 editorial in the journal Intelligence, 52 signatories wrote, “I.Q. is strongly related, probably more so than any other single measurable human trait, to many important educational, occupational, economic and social outcomes.” Similar conclusions were affirmed in a unanimous blue-ribbon report by the American Psychological Association. . . <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">A few things here are worth mentioning:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">First, the editorial in question made a number of other arguments that, I think, most observers would agree fall on one end of the nature-nurture continuum: that all IQ tests measure the same thing, that heredity is more important than environment in determining it, that group differences are relatively unaffected by schooling or socioeconomic factors. It also said that the IQs of different races cluster at different points, with the average IQ of blacks falling about a standard deviation lower than that of whites, and that these differences show no sign of converging over time. <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt"><o:p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"></span></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Second, two thirds of the editorial board of the journal Intelligence declined to sign the statement.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman">Third, the statement originally appeared on the op-ed page of the Wall Street Journal in 1994, explicitly in defense of “The Bell Curve,” a book whose supporters are typically quite happy to call one of the most controversial books of the past 25 years. <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt"><o:p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"></span></o:p></span></p>

Before Congress he testified that IQ data proved that 83 percent of Jewish immigrants were born feeble-minded and therefore were a threat to the nation&#39;s economy and genetic makeup. Laughlin subsequently lobbied to keep those barriers in place, successfully cutting off sanctuary for Jews seeking refuge from the Third Reich.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

Jensen (who has cited the heritability of IQ to argue against interventions to boost academic performance of minorities), J.

The amount of education someone receives then itself has an effect on social status. (&quot;In summary, intelligence test scores predict a wide range of social outcomes with varying degrees of success. Correlations are highest for educational achievement, where they account for about a quarter of the variance.&quot;) The paper points out that one reason intelligence scores predict occupational level is that &quot;admission to many professions depends on test scores in the first place,&quot; and also explores the evidence that &quot;workplaces may affect the intelligence of those who work in them.&quot; It delves into the Flynn effect, and the various possible explanations for it; and suggests that what little evidence is available &quot;fails to support the genetic hypothesis&quot; for the black/white differential in psychometric scores. <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

The fact that ideas are sometimes supported by people with unsavory connections does not make them invalid. An ice floe is not necessarily a bad place to be. It’s just that if you are plainly floating on one, it doesn’t make much sense to insist that you are standing on solid ground. <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

				<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><o:p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">&#0160;</span></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A few more thoughts on quarterbacks:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><o:p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">&#0160;</span></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">There are two separate issues with respect to quarterbacks. The first is whether, historically, NFL teams have done a good job of predicting which college quarterbacks will succeed in the pros. Dave Berri and Rob Simmons’ paper in the <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/k96t8116v8686350/">Journal of Productivity Analysis</a> (that I relied on in the essay “Most Likely to Succeed” in my new book “What The Dog Saw”) proves pretty convincingly, I think, that the answer is no. One of the best parts of that paper is how Berri and Simmons demonstrate how much NFL teams tend to irrationally over-weight “combine” variables like speed, height and Wonderlic score. <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">	 </span>There’s a second wonderful paper on this general subject by Cade Massey and Richard Thaler—Thaler being, of course, one of the leading lights in behavioral economics—called “<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=697121">The Loser’s Curse</a>.” The argument of the Thaler-Massey paper goes something like this (and I encourage anyone who is interested in sports to read the whole thing, because I can’t do it justice here). By looking at the trades that NFL teams make, we can estimate the “market value” of a draft pick. And what we find is that teams place a very high value on high first round picks. The first pick in the draft, they write, has historically been valued as much as “the 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> picks combined, and as much as the sum of the last four picks in the first round.” Then Thaler and Massey calculate the true value of draft picks, using what they call “surplus value.” The key here is that all NFL teams operate under a strict salary cap. So a player’s real worth to a team is the extent to which his performance exceeds the average performance of someone making his salary. And what do they find? That market value and surplus value are radically out of sync: that teams irrationally over-weight the importance of high first round picks. In fact, according to their analysis, the most useful draft picks are in the second round, not the first: that’s where surplus values tend to be highest. Hence the title of the paper: “The Loser’s Curse.” The NFL rewards its weakest teams by giving them the highest draft picks—but those picks are actually not the most valuable picks in the draft. <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </span>It is important to note here that we are talking about <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">relative</em> value. Personnel decisions in the NFL have clear opportunity costs: if you pay $15 million for a quarterback who only gives you $10 million of value, then you hve $5 million less to pay for a good linebacker. As they write: “To be clear, the player taken with the first pick does have the highest expected performance . . . but he also has the highest salary, and in terms of performance per dollar, is less valuable than players taken in the second round.”<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">	 </span>What Massey and Thaler are saying, in essence, is that NFL general managers are <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</em> rational decision-makers. That’s why I think its so useful in this particular discussion. Those who believe that draft position is a good predictor of quarterback performance are essentially voting for the good judgment of the people who make draft decisions. And what Berri and Simmons in particular—and Massey and Thaler in general—remind us is that that kind of blind faith in the likes of Matt Millen and Al Davis simply isn’t justified. And, by the way, why should that fallibility come as a surprise? We’ve known for a long time that it is not easy to making decisions under conditions of extreme uncertainty. Here is Massey and Thaler from their conclusion: <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">	 </span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"></span></font>&#0160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Numerous studies find, for example, that physicians, among the most educated professionals in our society, make diagnoses that display overconfidence and violate Bayes’ rule. The point, of course, is that physicians are experts at medicine, not necessarily probabilistic reasoning. And it should not be surprising that when faced with difficult problems, such as inferring the probability that a patient has cancer from a given test, physicians will be prone to the same types of errors that subjects display in the laboratory. Such findings reveal only that physicians are human.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font size="3"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">	 </span>Our modest claim in this paper is that the owners and managers of National Football League teams are also human, and that market forces have not been strong enough to overcome these human failings. The task of picking players, as we have described here, is an extremely difficult one . . . Teams must first make predictions about the future performance of (frequently) immature young men. Then they must make judgments about their own abilities: how much confidence should the team have in its forecasting skills? As we detailed in section 2, human nature conspires to make it extremely difficult to avoid overconfidence in this task. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&#0160;</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&#0160;&#0160; </span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&#0160;&#0160; </span>This brings up the second question. Is it possible to <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">ever</em> accurately predict which college quarterbacks will succeed in the pros? Both the Thaler analysis and the Berri analysis hold out the real possibility that teams can be a lot smarter than they currently are. The New England Patriots clearly have taken some of Thaler’s lessons to heart, for example. There has also been a real effort by the folks over at Pro Football Outsiders to come up with a more useful algorithm for making quarterback selections. David Lewin’s “career forecast” zeroes in on career college starts and career college completion percentage as the best predictors of professional performance. </span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I took the position in my essay “Most Likely to Succeed” that I didn’t think that quarterbacking (as opposed to other positions on the field) was predictable in this sense—that there is so much noise in the data, and so much variability between the college and professional games—that attempts at rationalizing draft day decisions have real limits. I’m still of that inclination. I’m willing to be convinced, though. I’d love to see more statistically-minded people weigh in on the Lewin analysis, and I’d also like to have a better handle over how the recent innovations in college offenses—particularly the use of ever more aggressive spread formations—affects the accuracy of that algorithm. <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

But since football has been on my mind these days, I do want to make one small observation about his comments. <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 17pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&#0160; </span>In one of my essays, I wrote that the position a quarterback is taken in the college draft is not a reliable indicator of his performance as a professional. That was based on the work of the academic economists David Berri and Rob Simmons, who, in a paper published the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Journal of Productivity Analysis, </em><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&#0160;</span>analyze forty years of National Football League data. Their conclusion was that the relation between aggregate quarterback performance and draft position was weak. Further, when they looked at <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">per-play</em> performance—in other words, when they adjusted for the fact that highly drafted quarterbacks are more likely to play more downs—they found that quarterbacks taken in positions 11 through 90 in the draft actually slightly outplay those more highly paid and lauded players taken in the draft’s top ten positions. I found this analysis fascinating. Pinker did not. This quarterback argument, he wrote, “is simply not true.”<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 17pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; </span>I wondered about the basis of Pinker’s conclusion, so I e-mailed him, asking if he could tell me where to find the scientific data that would set me straight. He very graciously wrote me back. He had three sources, he said. The first was Steve Sailer. Sailer, for the uninitiated, is a </span><st1:state><st1:place><span style="FONT-SIZE: 17pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">California</span></st1:place></st1:state><span style="FONT-SIZE: 17pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"> blogger with a marketing background who is best known for his belief that black people are intellectually inferior to white people. Sailer’s “proof” of the connection between draft position and performance is, I’m sure Pinker would agree, crude: his key variable is how many times a player has been named to the Pro Bowl. Pinker’s second source was a blog post, based on four years of data, written by someone who runs a pre-employment testing company, who also failed to appreciate—as far as I can tell (the key part of the blog post is only a paragraph long)—the distinction between aggregate and per-play performance. Pinker’s third source was an article in the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Columbia Journalism Review</em>, prompted by my essay, that made an argument partly based on a link to a blog called “Niners Nation.&quot; I have enormous respect for Professor Pinker, and his description of me as “minor genius” made even my mother blush. But maybe on the question of subjects like quarterbacks, we should agree that our differences owe less to what can be found in the scientific literature than they do to what can be found on Google. </span></span></p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<P>My latest New Yorker piece, on how David beats Goliath, is <A href="https://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/05/11/090511fa_fact_gladwell?yrail">here.</A>&nbsp;
<P>I've been very pleased with the reaction. I did want to respond, though, to a number of comments that have been made about the parts of the piece dealing with Rick Pitino and college basketball. (Nothing is quite as fun as arguing about sports,)</P>
<P>Since most of the commenters make the same arguments,&nbsp;I'm going to pick a post &nbsp;by Ben Mathis-Lilley, over at New York magazine's blog. He writes, in part:</P>
<P><strong>The truth is that almost every team tries to make its opponents work for all 94 feet in some fashion, and not every underdog is born to run a full-court press. For example, take a team of mediocre players plus two pretty good athletes — one a tiny but quick guard, the other a big man who’s strong but slow on his feet. If that team ran a full-court press, the opposition would exploit the big guy by sending the player he guards sprinting down the floor on a fast break, while the small guard would be wasted guarding someone who probably doesn’t have possession, since the standard reaction to a press is to pass the ball around. A better strategy would be for the quick guard to pressure the opposition’s ball handler while the other players retreat, giving the big guy time to lurk near the basket and shot-block.</strong></P>
<P>The first sentence--that almost every team makes its opponents work for all 94 feet--is, of course, nonsense. But the rest of the paragraph makes perfect sense. The press is not for everyone. But then the piece never claimed that it was. I simply pointed out that insurgent strategies (substituting effort for ability and challenging conventions) represent one of David's only chances of competing successfully against Goliath, so it's surprising that more underdogs don't use them. The&nbsp;data on underdogs in war is quite compelling in this regard. But it's also&nbsp;true on the basketball court.&nbsp;&nbsp;The press isn't perfect. But given its track record, surely it is under-utilized. Isn't that strange? </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The New York piece then goes on:</P>
<P><strong>The most misleading part of Gladwell’s case concerns Rick Pitino, the Kentucky coach who was famously defeated on a last-second play by Duke in the 1992 NCAA tournament when he decided not to guard Grant Hill, who was inbounding the ball (ignoring the inbounder is a key component of the press).</strong> </P>
<P>Hmmm.&nbsp;Small point.&nbsp;Ignoring the inbounder is not a key component of the press. It is a key component of <em>some</em>versions of the press. Pitino also uses a version of the press that does guard the inbounder.&nbsp;(Also Pitino is no longer the coach at Kentucky. He's now the Louisville coach.) The piece then objects to my attempt to "shoehorn Pitino's teams into the underdog category" because Pitino's 1996 Kentucky team "featured featured a staggering <em>nine</em> players who would go on to play in the NBA." A number of others have pointed this out, and I'm still somewhat baffled by the criticism.</P>
<P>Pitino has been a college&nbsp;head coach since 1978 at&nbsp;four schools--Boston University, Providence College, Kentucky and the University of Louisville. At BU, he took over a team that had won 17 games in the two years before his arrival. He went 91-51 in five years, and took the team to the NCAA. At Providence, he took over a team that had gone 11-20 the year before.&nbsp;Two years later,&nbsp;he won 25 games and went to the Final Four with what may have been one of the most spectacularly untalented teams to have ever reached that level. And at Louisville he took his team to their first final four in 19 years in 2005. The star of that squad? Francisco Garcia. Ever heard of him? Exactly. Not to mention this year's Louisville squad which reached the Elite Eight with really only one NBA caliber player. You can also make an argument (and Bill Simmons at ESPN does) that Pitino did an awful lot with a very little while at the Boston Celtics, briefly, in 1998. Pitino's Kentucky experience is an anomaly. And by the way the nine players who got drafted into the NBA off that anomalous 1996 Kentucky squad consisted of eight journeymen and one, marginal star--Antoine Walker. Pitino has had a fraction of the talent that his contemporaries at Kansas, Carolina, Duke or Connecticut have had. </P>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>David Brooks wrote a very thoughtful <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/16/opinion/16brooks.html">column</a> in the New York Times yesterday on &quot;Outliers.&quot; Much of what he said was very flattering.</p>
<p>I have just two comments in response.</p>
<p>1. Brooks argues that I &quot;slight the centrality of individual character and individual creativity&quot; by focusing so much on the cultural and contextual determinants of success. Successful people, he says, must begin with two beliefs--&quot;that the future can be better than the present, and I have the power to make it so.&quot; I completely agree.&#0160; The chapter on lawyers, for example, is devoted to the idea of &quot;meaningful work,&quot; which is just what Brooks is talking about here, the perception that there is a connection in our daily life between effort and reward. It&#39;s such that I think that the belief in meaningful work is socially constructed. Those highly successful children and grandchildren of Jewish immigrants who are the subject of that lawyers chapter were not successful because each, independently, happened to be endowed with&#0160;the magical genetic trait of self-efficacy.&#0160; They were successful because their very fortunate cultural circumstances gave them that belief in meaningful work. Nurture here is driving nature, not the other way around.</p>
<p>2. Brooks suggests that Outliers represents a kind of social determinism. But that&#39;s an odd comment to make in the context of a column championing the role of nature over nurture. It&#39;s only nature that is unchangable and deterministic. Nuture, by definition, isn&#39;t. And the last half of Outliers is devoted to showing that when we confront our cultural legacies--whether it&#39;s in the cockpit or the classroom--we can make a big difference in how well we do our jobs.&#0160; </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>My latest New Yorker piece, <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/2008/2008_12_15_a_teacher.html">&quot;Most Likely to Succeed&quot;</a> is now up. </p>
<p>A couple of additional thoughts.</p>
<p>In some of the responses to the piece, I&#39;ve seen some resistance to the idea that choosing &#0160;NFL quarterbacks and choosing public school teachers represent the same category&#0160;of problem.&#0160; There are only a small number of NFL quarterbacks, and we are selecting candidates from a tiny pool of highly elite athletes. By contrast, we need a vast number of public school teachers and we&#39;re recruiting from an enormous non-elite pool to fill that need.&#0160; So, the response has gone, it&#39;s apples and oranges.</p>
<p>Precisely! But of course non-symetrical comparisons are far more interesting and thought-provoking than symetrical comparisons. If I wrote a piece about how finding good point guards in the NBA was a&#0160;lot like finding good quarterbacks in the NFL, the comparison would be exact. And as a result, it would be relatively useless.&#0160; What new light does the addition of a second, identical example shed on the first? </p>
<p>&#0160;What makes an idea thought-provoking, to my mind, is the extent to which we are forced to make an effort to assimilate apparently contradictory or at least antagonistic&#0160;notions. Roger Martin, the dean of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, has a wonderful book out on this very idea <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Opposable-Mind-Successful-Integrative-Thinking/dp/1422118924/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1229464513&amp;sr=1-1">(&quot;The Opposable Mind&quot;)</a>.&#0160; He argues that what distinguishes successful business leaders is their ability to reconcile apparently irreconcilable options.&#0160; So, for example, the genius of Izzy Sharpe, the founder of the Four Seasons chain, is that he was&#0160;the first to understand that a hotelier doesn&#39;t have to choose between the advantages of a large hotel (breadth of services) and the advantages of a small hotel (intimacy). For years everyone assumed those were mutually exclusive categories. Sharpe realized that you can, in fact, do both. Martin&#39;s book made me think that there is value in pushing the envelope on comparisons.</p>
<p>All of this is a long way of saying that instead of resisting the implausibility of the pairing of NFL quarterbacks and teachers, it is actually more interesting to embrace it. And what happens when you do that? You discover that the psychological situation facing the gatekeeper&#0160;in both cases is identical: that&#0160;confronted with a prediction deficit, the human impulse is to tighten standards, when it fact it should be to loosen standards. </p>
<p>Second point:</p>
<p>One weakness of the piece, I think, is that I didn&#39;t spell out another of the parallels between good quarterbacks and good teachers. One of the obvious implications of the notion that the college experience does not predict professional quarterback success is that professional quarterbacking is a skill learned only in the pros.&#0160;That is, what matters more than anything in predicting professional success is the quality of the learning environment that the quarterback is drafted into, not the&#0160;quality of the experience he was drafted <em>from</em>.&#0160; (Think Matt Cassell&#39;s rather remarkable performance this year: surely that&#39;s a consequence of being drafted into one of the league&#39;s best learning cultures). </p>
<p>My brother, an elementary school principal, believes very strongly along these&#0160;same lines:&#0160;that effective mentoring of a new teacher can make an enormous difference in that&#0160;person&#39;s ability to become a &quot;star&quot; teacher. But the problem, he argues, is that the process of mentorship is much too haphazard. As he says, &quot;It&#39;s like training NFL quarterbacks by randomly sending them out to teams - some CFL teams, some Division&#0160;III teams, some Division&#0160;I College teams, some community teams, and a few to NFL teams.&quot;&#0160; </p>
<p>It strikes me that one very logical response to the quarterback problem is not just to lower entry standards, and be willing to make after-the-fact judgments of quality, but also to spend a great deal more time and attention on the issue of talent development. If Matt Cassell can thrive in the NFL, after essentially zero college quarterback experience, what exactly is New England doing right? And what can the rest of&#0160;the league learn from them? Maybe that should be the subject of a follow-up piece. </p>
